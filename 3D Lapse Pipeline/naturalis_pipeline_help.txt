------------------------3-D CT SCAN TIMELAPSE PIPELINE-------------------------

	-	This pipeline builds a 3-D timelapse out of
		reconstructed CT scan images.

				NECESSITIES
	-	The CT scanned images must be reconstructed
		first, before integrated into this pipeline.
	-	The images should have a .tiff file format
	-	All the reconstructions should have the same
		dimensions for the pipeline to work correctly,
		if this is not the case, the reconstructions
		will be trimmed from the top until it meets
		the correct dimensions
	-	When a reconstruction has too little images,
		blank images should be added to the top.
	-	This pipeline should be run on a linux system,
		or a similar environment.
	-	When run locally, the local PC should have 
		Avizo (preferably version 9.5) installed
	-	Several packages containing Python extesnions
		must be installed: FLEXData, FLEXTomo and
		FLEXCalc produced by CWI Amsterdam
		These can be found at:
		

	
				COMPONENTS	
	-	Rawedit.py Python script:	
		This script prepares the raw 
		reconstructions by trimming images when the
		reconstructions are too large, removing
		unnecessary files within the folder, adding
		the necessary "geometry.toml" file.
	-	Timelapse.py Python script:
		This script processes batch images. There
		are three parts: Scheduling and runtime of
		input operations, scheduling and runtime of
		reconstruction and restoration and restart
		of a crashed process. (Written by CWI)
	-	Avizo editing command:
		Starts Avizo 9.5 and opens the Avizo Edit
		Python script and a single reconstruction
		at a time. This rule is called as often
		as there are reconstructions found.
	-	Avizo movie construction:
		Combines all edited reconstructions into
		a 3D-Timelapse movie
	-	Help:
		Displays the help message


				
	       		  RUNNING THE PIPELINE
	-	Prior to any attempt of running the pipeline,
		the correct packages should be installed.
		If these are installed using Anaconda, the 
		correct environment should be opened first.
	-	This pipeline can be run by using the 	
		following command:
	> snakemake -s Minisnake --use-conda -T -R all
	-	To run a single rule, use:
	> snakemake -s Minisnake --use-conda -T <insert rule>
