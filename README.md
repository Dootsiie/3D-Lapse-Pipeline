# 3D Lapse Pipeline
This pipeline constructs a 3D time-lapse video of a series of reconstructions, originating from CT scans. This project was a Final Thesis project and a collaboration between Naturalis Biodiversity Center and CWI Amsterdam.

Installation
Prior to use of this pipeline, the FlexBox software developed by CWI Amsterdam should be installed first. All rights on this software package go to CWI Amsterdam. A guide to installation can be found in the following repositories.
https://github.com/cicwi/flexDATA

https://github.com/cicwi/flexTOMO

https://github.com/cicwi/flexCALC

After downloading the 3D time-lapse pipeline folder, the folders flexData, flexTomo and flexCalc inside the similarly named repositories (which contain the scripts) should be moved into the downloaded 3D time-lapse folder.
Besides this, FFMPEG and 3D Slicer visualization software should be downloaded. For the pipeline to work correctly, 3D Slicer should be installed into the 3D time-lapse folder. Download links are found below:
